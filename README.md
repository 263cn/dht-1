This is a Kademlia/Bittorrent DHT that implements BEP 5.

It's typically used by a torrent client such as
[Taipei-Torrent](http://github.com/nictuku/Taipei-Torrent), but it could also
be used by a standalone DHT routers, or for other more creative purposes.

The DHT performs well and supports the most important features despite its
simple API.

For usage details and examples, see the online documentation at:
